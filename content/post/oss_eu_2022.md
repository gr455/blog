I have been involved with Open Source for the past 3 years and this September, I got to attend the Open Source Summit in Dublin. This was the first time I attended OSS (or any international conference for that matter) and the experience was unparalleled.

This blog briefs my experience at the Open Source Summit, and contains a bunch of pictures from there

I had applied to the scholarship in the beginning of July and got the acceptance by end of July. Then followed the tedious process of applying for a visa. Collecting documents, booking appointments and the horrible waiting for the decisions. Although Ireland is pretty lax in terms of granting visas, I was worried that it may not get to me on time (in fact, one of my friends got his visa just 2 days before leaving for the conference). Fortunately, I ended up getting my visa about a week before leaving.

## Day 0, 1: MLH Event and Getting to OSS
The day I landed, I had an invitation to go to the MLH Day 0 party before the summit began. It was a fun time. I met the man himself, Mike Swift - the founder of MLH. What a guy, he came up to us and asked about our experiences in Open Source and shared his own. He talked about why and how he started MLH and what it took to make the MLH that it is today.

Next day was the first day of the Open Source Summit. We picked up our badges and walked around the convention centre before the talks began.

## Talks and Keynotes
I am not exaggerating when I say, the talks were mind-blowing. The very first talk I attended was by Gerlof Langeveld where he built a container from scratch! He used linux namespaces to isolate processes and showed exactly how containers are so lightweight (compared to hardware virtualization). And this was just one of the many amazing talks I attended.

On day 3, the main keynotes were scheduled. One by Linus Torvalds himself, where he talked about his experience with the new ARM based MacBooks (he seemed to like them), and including Rust in the kernel. Another keynote session by Liz Rice was about eBPF (a recent development in cloud native that I have been studying about) and the Cilium Service Mesh.

But the keynote that really moved the audience was the one by Mark Pollock - an explorer who, despite being blind and paralysed; finished the race to the South Pole. This was not a technical talk, but definitely one of the best ones at the OSS.

## The Sponsor Showcase

One of the best parts of the Open Source Summit was the sponsor showcase. This is where different organizations who have sponsored the OSS set up booths to show off their latest developments. This is where you get your exclusive ✨ Open Source Summit merch ✨

IBM showed off their beefy LinuxONE server, Styra showed off their OPA based Declarative Authorization Service, Nginx showed off their new Nginx Unit. There was a guy that ran DOOM on a docker container. There were freaking arcade machines!

This is the place where I talked to so many awesome people in tech. I even got to talk to Liz Rice, and got a signed copy of her eBPF book :D

## Touring Dublin
Now, of course I wasn't going to leave without touring Dublin. The Linux Foundation had organized a bunch of touring activities themself. There was a boat tour of River Liffey, a bus tour of the Dublin City (which I missed because I slept through it) and a tour of the Guinness Storehouse. The Guinness Storehouse tour was particuarly interesting, they showcased the preperation of the iconic Guinness Beer and we also got to drink some (not to my liking, I'm sure it's an acquired taste, though) and eat some Irish food (this one WAS to my liking :D)

Apart from these, I also went out with the other folks from India who were attending the Open Source Summit. We went to the Trinity College, the Sandymount Beach and Malahide.

## Closing Thoughts
The Open Source Summit was an absolutely worthwhile experience. The talks were at least miles better than any other conference I have attended. You will find people from all over the world working on something cool, you might also get to meet some of the big names in open source.

This experience made me want to attend (maybe speak at?) more LF events, so I will be attending the KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA virtually this year too. And hopefully even more events next year!
